Hello yall! Thanks for your interest in this project. I have made a ship model in blender with a couple of birds here and there inspired by one piece! Sorry I could not render my model due to hardware limitations but here is the sketchfab link: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/one-piece-ship-4488c197440648ee847784224a5cc345 Below are the screenshots:
